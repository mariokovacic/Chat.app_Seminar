# Chat.app
This was not my independent work and I'm grateful for all the help because it helped me finish school. 
Government gave me a voucher with which I paid this school, and the condition to not give money back was to finish school. That was my motiv to seek help because I could not afford, literally not afford a failure.
As a proof of being grateful I did continue to improve past the Chat.app level. 
With no worries on my mind regarding finishing school I am continuing to improve and build my portfolio.
It is 10.11.2023. When I'm writing this READ.me.
In the meantime I've built my own version of Chat.app by myself.
